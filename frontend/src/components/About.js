          Hello! I am Shekinah Sardonyx Yadala, a passionate Software Engineer based in the United States.
          With a Master's degree in Computer Science and a strong background in Electrical & Electronic Engineering,
          I bridge the gap between hardware logic and software scalability.

        <br />
        <p>
          My expertise lies in building robust Cloud Solutions using AWS, creating seamless Full-Stack applications
          with Java Spring Boot and React, and automating deployment pipelines using modern DevOps tools.

        <br />
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new tech trends, optimizing algorithms, or enjoying a good cup of coffee.
